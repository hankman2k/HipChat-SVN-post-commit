post-commit: Hook used for SVN post commits

This script is set to publish information after SVN commits to HipChat. 

The script uses the hipchat-cli to do all the heavy lifting. This is required, 
unless you want to create/use a different hipchat-cli.

Required files/Application/services:
    * hipchat_room_message:  https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-cli
    * Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/
    * Working repository (you're on your own here)
    * HipChat account and room setup: https://www.hipchat.com/
    * HipChat token created: https://www.hipchat.com/groups/api

The use of "post-commit" as the name of the file is required and must be placed in the "/hooks" directory 
of your repository. Each repository will need it's own "post-commit" hook. For windows based SVN systems, 
add ".bat" to the file name.

The hipchat-cli can be placed anywhere on the filesystem. The location can be set in the script file.

The user MUST edit the script file to add in
    * hipchat token
    * hipcaht room number
    * location of hipchat-cli
    * a user name for display in hipchat
    * location of svnlook command. In RedHat/CentOS /usr/bin/svnlook

To test:
    1) Edit script file
    2) chmod 755 script file
    3) # ./post-commit <svn repo> <rev #>
    where <svn repo> is your full path to the repository and <rev #> is any number. 
    The REV number does not have to be accurate.
    4) Look at your log in HipChat and verify that information was posted.
    5) Finally, add/update a file in your checked out repository and commit. 
    6) Look at your log in HipChat and verify that information was poster.

Note from author:

If you like this script and get use out of it, give back! Yep. You too can give something back to the open source communities.
If you can give code, give money to your favorite open source program. Keep open source alive.
